## 🧪 Test Drive (Remote Demo)

🚀 Skip the setup — experience FastFlowLM instantly on a live AMD Ryzen™ AI 5 340 NPU with 32 GB memory ([more spec](https://www.amazon.com/4X4-BOX-AI340-Display-Support-Copilot/dp/B0F2GFLF67/ref=sr_1_5?crid=1X16RDUCQ2497&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.C5GS4xMl_kkJ7Yr6dNFi6g.Dfj_l9Dk1yuIBjppqmKSqNAAPQc1F4Mu3zJ9-MDlszw&dib_tag=se&keywords=4x4+box+ai340&qid=1752010554&sprefix=www.amazon.com%2F4X4-BOX-AI340%2Caps%2C176&sr=8-5)):

🌐 **Launch Now**: [https://open-webui.testdrive-fastflowlm.com/](https://open-webui.testdrive-fastflowlm.com/)  
🔐 **Login**: `guest@flm.npu`  
🔑 **Password**: `0000`

> Alternatively, **sign up** with your own credentials instead of using the shared guest account.
> ⚠️ Some universities or companies may **block access** to the test drive site. If it doesn't load over Wi-Fi, try switching to a **cellular network**.  
> Real-time demo powered by **FastFlowLM + Open WebUI** — no downloads, no installs.  
> Try optimized LLM models: `llama3.2:1b`, `llama3.2:3b`, `qwen3:4b`, etc. — all accelerated on NPU.

⚠️ **Please note**:  
- FastFlowLM is designed for **single-user local use**. This remote demo machine may experience short wait times when **multiple users** access it concurrently — please be patient.  
- When switching models, it may take longer time to replace the model in memory.
- Large prompts (30k+ tokens) may take longer — but it works.
