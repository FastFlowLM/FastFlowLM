# üîç RAG with Live Web Search + FastFlowLM Summarizer

This project demonstrates how to build a lightweight Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that:
- Performs live web search using `ddgs` (DuckDuckGo)
- Summarizes the results using a local LLM via **FastFlowLM**
- Runs fully offline except for the web search

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

- Windows machine
- Python 3.9 or later
- [FastFlowLM](https://github.com/FastFlowLM/FastFlowLM) installed
- FastFlowLM model served (e.g., `llama3.2:1b`)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. üß™ Create the Project Folder

```powershell
mkdir rag_websearch_flm
cd rag_websearch_flm
```

### 2. üêç Create a Virtual Environment

```powershell
python -m venv rag_websearch-env
.\rag_websearch-env\Scripts\activate
```

> üí° If PowerShell blocks script execution:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

---

### 3. üì¶ Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install langchain langchain-ollama ddgs
```

---

### 4. üöÄ Launch FastFlowLM

In another terminal:

```bash
flm serve llama3.2:1b
```

This starts your FastFlowLM API at: `http://localhost:11434`

---

### 5. üìù Create the Script: `websearch_rag.py`

```python
# websearch_rag.py

import warnings
from ddgs import DDGS
from langchain_ollama import OllamaLLM
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=ResourceWarning)


def run_web_search(query: str, max_results: int = 5) -> str:
    """Perform a DuckDuckGo search using the ddgs package."""
    print(f"\nüîç Running web search for: '{query}'")
    results = []

    try:
        with DDGS() as ddgs:
            for r in ddgs.text(query, max_results=max_results):
                title = r.get("title", "No title")
                body = r.get("body", "No description")
                link = r.get("href", "No link")
                results.append(f"‚Ä¢ {title}\n  {body}\n  üîó {link}\n")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Error during search: {e}")
        return ""

    return "\n".join(results)


def summarize_with_fastflowlm(search_results: str, model_name="llama3.2:1b") -> str:
    """Summarize search results using FastFlowLM via OllamaLLM."""
    if not search_results.strip():
        return "‚ö†Ô∏è No search results to summarize."

    llm = OllamaLLM(model=model_name, base_url="http://localhost:11434")

    prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template("""
You are a factual and concise research assistant. Summarize the following web search results clearly and accurately.

Search Results:
{search_results}

Summary:
""")

    try:
        summary = (prompt | llm).invoke({"search_results": search_results})
    except Exception as e:
        return f"‚ùå Error generating summary: {e}"

    return summary.strip()


def main():
    """Main routine for web search + summarization using FastFlowLM."""
    query = "Recent developments in AMD Ryzen AI chips"

    search_output = run_web_search(query, max_results=5)

    print("\nüåê Raw Web Search Output:\n")
    print(search_output or "‚ö†Ô∏è No results.")

    summary = summarize_with_fastflowlm(search_output)
    print("\nüß† Summary:\n")
    print(summary)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Script

Make sure FastFlowLM is running, then:

```bash
python websearch_rag.py
```
